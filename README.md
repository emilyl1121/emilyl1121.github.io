<br>
This website is my first HTML and CSS project! I made a simple website that contains two main pages and acts as a project gallery for my resume. The gallery pages contains the links to the public github repo so people can access my project codes and files. In the main page, there is a simple "about" section which contains a picture of me and some simple descriptions. There are also buttons that leads you to my socials and communications.
<br>
I made this website because I wanter a creative space to update my skills, projects, and descriptions about me, kind of like a resume, but cooler! I also want to customize according to my aesthetic preferences. 
<br>

I struggled at first with my lack of experience in HTML and CSS, as I only ever learned by simple tutorials and some exercises on my own. I had to look up a lot of simple properties and basic rules of HTML. However, I learned through this project about the basic styling of CSS and gained a lot of experience through it!
